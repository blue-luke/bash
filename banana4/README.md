# Bash exercises

## banana

This exercise sees me create a folder and text file with a script, write to teh text file, print to the terminal, then automate the deletion of the folder and its contents with a 2nd script

## banana2

One script calls another

To add text to a file:
echo "One script calls another" >> README.txt

> Overwrites the file's contents

## banana3

Now adding the scripts to path so they can be executed from anywhere

## banana4

Now adding the path command to profile so it loads to the shell each time, surviving restarts, etc

This survives system reboot
