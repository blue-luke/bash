This exercise sees me create a folder and text file with a script, write to teh text file, print to the terminal, then automate the deletion of the folder and its contents with a 2nd script
One script calls another

To add text to a file:
echo "One script calls another" >> README.txt

> Overwrites the file's contents

Now adding the scripts to path so they can be executed from anywhere
